# Customer & Article Views SQL Project

This SQL project demonstrates relational database modeling and querying using SQLite.
It covers basic and advanced SQL queries, including joins, aggregations, and conditional filtering.

## Tables

- `customers`: customer info
- `orders`: customer orders with amounts and dates
- `views`: article views including authors and viewers

## Example Queries

- Total orders per customer
- Customers with no orders
- Highest order value
- Average order value by city
- Authors who viewed their own articles

## How to Use

Run `schema.sql` to create tables and `insert_data.sql` to populate them.
Then test queries inside the `queries` folder using SQLite CLI or DB Browser for SQLite.
